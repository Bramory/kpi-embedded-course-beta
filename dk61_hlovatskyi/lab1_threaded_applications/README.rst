Lab1: Threaded applications

That program creates N threads and make calculus with the same global variable.
Results depends on which optimisation flags are used during compilation.
Whether it's [-O0] - result is ugly, time for a executed larger than the second
    but with [-O2] - it seems great, you can check the differences in asm code.

For compiling use 'make'
